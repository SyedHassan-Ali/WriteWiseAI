## Prerequisites
To run this sample code it requires python environment and anaconda distibution.
## Usage
We have provided a sample project that trained on hand drawn objects (grapes, star, sun). We have not shared our data due to our privacy the real model will same as this but real model trained on hand written alphabets. 
There are two files in the repository.
1. [train.ipynb](https://github.com/SyedHassan-Ali/WriteWiseAI/blob/main/train.ipynb) (code to train model)
2. [sample.ipynb](https://github.com/SyedHassan-Ali/WriteWiseAI/blob/main/sample.ipynb) (to test the trained model)
## Run the code
You can run the sample.ipynb that contains the code to load the model and based on sample points of hand drawning model detects the object. 

## Important Notice

Our designed Innovation is based on hardware (custom designed structure with embedded systems) and software as it can be seen in the Video. 
We have submitted only a sample test of our application. The greater concept and real dataset can be demonstrated in the complete presentation.
