# WriteWiseAI
## Description
Write Wise AI will be an AI assitant of kids which will provide feedback in real time.
## Prerequisites
To run this sample code it requires python environment and anaconda distibution.
## Usage
We have provided a sample project that trained on hand drawn objects (grapes, star, sun). We have not shared our data due to our privacy the real model will same as this but real model trained on hand written alphabets. 
There are two files in the repository.
1. train.ipynb (code to train model)
2. sample.ipynb (to test the trained model)
## Run the code
You can run the sample.ipynb that contains the code to load the model and based on sample points of hand drawning model detects the object.
